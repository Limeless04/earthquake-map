# Earthquake Data Management Summary

## Current Implementation
The current implementation uses a custom hook `useEarthquakeData` that:
- Fetches earthquake data using SWR
- Normalizes the data using `normalizeFeature` utility
- Returns raw data, error state, and loading state
- Has a 10-second timeout for data fetching
- Implements error handling for failed requests

## Proposed Changes

### 1. State Management
- Implement Zustand store for centralized state management
- Move data fetching logic to the store
- Enable data sharing across multiple components
- Maintain data consistency across the application

### 2. Filtering Capabilities
- Add magnitude range filtering
  - Minimum and maximum magnitude filters
  - Real-time filter updates
- Add date range filtering
  - Start and end date selection
  - Support for different date formats
- Combine multiple filters
  - AND logic for multiple filter conditions
  - Reset functionality

### 3. Performance Considerations
- Implement memoization for filtered data
- Optimize re-renders using Zustand selectors
- Handle large datasets efficiently
- Maintain smooth UI performance during filtering

### 4. User Experience
- Real-time filter updates
- Smooth transitions between filtered states
- Clear feedback for loading and error states
- Intuitive filter controls

## Benefits
1. Centralized state management
2. Improved data sharing between components
3. Better performance with optimized filtering
4. Enhanced user experience with real-time updates
5. More maintainable and scalable codebase
