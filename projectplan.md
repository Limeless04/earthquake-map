# Earthquake Data Management Project Plan

## Overview
This project aims to implement a centralized state management solution using Zustand for earthquake data, enabling data sharing across multiple chart components and implementing filtering capabilities.

## Current Architecture
- [x] Data fetching is handled by `useEarthquakeData` hook using SWR
- [x] Data is normalized using `normalizeFeature` utility
- [x] Data structure follows `EarthquakeFeature` and `NormalizedFeature` types

## Implementation Checklist

### Phase 1: Zustand Store Setup âœ…
- [x] Install required dependencies
  - [x] zustand
  - [x] date-fns (for date filtering)

- [ ] Create store structure
  ```typescript
  // store/earthquakeStore.ts
  - Raw earthquake data
  - Filtered earthquake data
  - Filter states (magnitude range, date range)
  - Actions for updating filters
  ```

### Phase 2: Store Implementation
- [ ] Create basic store with:
  - [ ] State management for earthquake data
  - [ ] Filter states
  - [ ] Data transformation utilities

- [ ] Implement store actions:
  - [ ] Set earthquake data
  - [ ] Update magnitude filter
  - [ ] Update date filter
  - [ ] Reset filters
  - [ ] Get filtered data

### Phase 3: Filter Implementation
- [ ] Create filter interfaces:
  - [ ] Magnitude range filter
  - [ ] Date range filter

- [ ] Implement filter logic:
  - [ ] Filter by magnitude range
  - [ ] Filter by date range
  - [ ] Combine multiple filters

### Phase 4: Integration
- [ ] Modify `useEarthquakeData` hook to:
  - [ ] Fetch data
  - [ ] Update Zustand store
  - [ ] Return store data and actions

- [ ] Update chart components to:
  - [ ] Use store data
  - [ ] Implement filter controls
  - [ ] Subscribe to store updates

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Test store functionality
- [ ] Test filter implementations
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Error handling improvements

Total estimated time: 8 days

## Dependencies
- [x] zustand: ^4.4.1
- [x] date-fns: ^2.30.0

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All chart components can access earthquake data through the store
- [ ] Filtering works correctly for both magnitude and date ranges
- [ ] Performance is optimized for large datasets
- [ ] Error handling is robust
- [ ] Code is maintainable and well-documented
